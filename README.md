## Branches in ML
Mainly there are 2 branches in AI. Let's your task is to put potato and tomato in different basket.
### Supervised:
In this, you clearly show difference to the child that this red colour fruit like is tomato and other is potato. It is broadly classified as <b> Classification <b> and <b> Regression <b> 
### Unsupervised:
In this, you only say that categorize everything based on colour.

### Based on input and output relation:
Let's Y = 10X is relation and Y = 10X^n is another relation
1) Linear Relation
X of power 1 is linear
2) Non-Linear Relation
X of power n is non linear

## Classification & Regression: Type of <b> Supervised <b>

### Types of Regression:

<b>This predict the change in output variable based on  change in input variable <b>

It gives answer only in 0/1 or yes/No

This algorithm divides your data or information into as many decision tree or branches as possible.

This algorithm has a knowledge of certain independent parameters which might affect the outcome. Ex - if you could run a sentiment analysi. so you wouls say if there is a word called bad, then understand that this tweet has <b> negative review <b>. This relationship is non-linear and it's classification.

<p>This is like decision tree algo along with some extra layers. This makes multiple decision trees and takes the best start of them to predict the output. </p>
